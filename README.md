leasing made easy

## Introduction

bruinLeasy is a student-driven platform created specifically for UCLA students by UCLA students, aimed at facilitating the process of finding leases and subleases. With bruinLeasy, Bruins can easily connect and navigate through a centralized platform that brings together individuals seeking subleases and those offering their apartments for subleasing. Sublessors have the ability to create and manage property listings, while sublessees can efficiently search and filter listings based on essential criteria like price, start date, and amenities.
